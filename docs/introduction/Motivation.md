# Motivation

This package and CLI can be compared to tools like `yeoman` or `slush`, with the biggest difference that we see locally installed templates/scaffolds as first-class citizens and aim to provide the simplest but at the same time most flexible configuration possible for creators of templates/scaffolds. This means that you can use private scaffolds as you are not required to publish them on npmjs or host them in your projects `node_modules`, instead just configure the CLI to search in different directories for templates.

This CLI is built with a high expectation to developer experience from the ground up. If you choose to use this CLI, you will end up with a powerful companion on your side to bootstrap modules in your project, so let's jump straight into the [Configuration of the CLI](/docs/cli/Configuration.md) and get started!
